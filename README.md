### About Me
#### I am a Marine Veteran who found his love of coding and solving problems in late 2019. At that time I was doing small classes on Udemy and Code Academy, and messing around with Javascript in IDEs. I first got introduced to the wonderful world of code while traveling around in South America. I had been traveling for a year and wanted to keep going, but I knew it would end because I needed money. Then I met a gentleman during breakfast at a hostel in Peru working off his laptop. I asked him what he did, and he told me he freelanced for a startup company. I was immediately intrigued and looked it up that day. That was when I realized I can do something I love, while doing something I love!
